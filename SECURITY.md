# Security Documentation - EventsDC Document POC

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the EventsDC Document POC system and provides guidance for security testing and hardening.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with access and refresh tokens
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **Token expiration** and refresh mechanisms
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
- **Brute force protection** with IP tracking

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **File upload validation** with type, size, and content checks
- **Query sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **Filename sanitization** to prevent path traversal
- **Input length limits** on all user inputs
- **Content-Type validation** for file uploads

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### File Upload Security
- **File type validation** (only PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT allowed)
- **File size limits** (50MB maximum)
- **Filename sanitization** and length limits
- **Dangerous extension blocking** (.exe, .bat, .cmd, etc.)
- **Path traversal protection**

### Rate Limiting
- **Request rate limiting** (100 requests per hour per IP)
- **Per-endpoint rate limiting** for sensitive operations
- **IP-based tracking** with automatic blocking
- **Graceful degradation** when limits are exceeded

### Logging & Monitoring
- **Security event logging** for all suspicious activities
- **Failed login tracking** with IP monitoring
- **Request logging** with response times and status codes
- **System metrics collection** (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring

## üß™ Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests

Run the comprehensive security test suite:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

# Run security tests
python -m pytest tests/test_security.py -v
```

### Manual Security Testing

#### 1. Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test successful login
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin123"

# Test failed login (should be rate limited after multiple attempts)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -d "username=admin&password=wrongpassword"
```

#### 2. File Upload Security Testing
```bash
# Test malicious filename
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest" \
  -F "file=@test.txt;filename=../../../etc/passwd"

# Test oversized file
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest" \
  -F "file=@large_file.txt"  # > 50MB

# Test dangerous file type
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest" \
  -F "file=@malicious.exe"
```

#### 3. Input Validation Testing
```bash
# Test SQL injection
curl "http://localhost:8000/search/hybrid?q='; DROP TABLE users; --"

# Test XSS
curl "http://localhost:8000/search/hybrid?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# Test long query
curl "http://localhost:8000/search/hybrid?q=$(python -c 'print("x"*2000)')"
```

#### 4. Rate Limiting Testing
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..150}; do
  curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
done
```

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Critical security settings in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Authentication
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=3600

# File Upload Security
MAX_FILE_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB
MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH=255
MAX_QUERY_LENGTH=1000

# CORS (restrict in production)
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]
```

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] **Change default credentials** (admin/admin123)
- [ ] **Generate strong SECRET_KEY** (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] **Configure proper CORS origins** (not wildcard)
- [ ] **Set up SSL/TLS certificates**
- [ ] **Configure firewall rules**
- [ ] **Set up log monitoring and alerting**
- [ ] **Regular security updates**
- [ ] **Backup and recovery procedures**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes:**

1. **This is a proof-of-concept system** - Additional security hardening is required for production use
2. **Default credentials must be changed** before any production deployment
3. **Regular security updates** are essential for maintaining security posture
4. **Professional security assessment** is recommended before production deployment
5. **Monitor security logs** continuously for suspicious activities
